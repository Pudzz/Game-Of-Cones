# Game-Of-Cones
A small game made during a course in school. In this project we were 6 people who participated.

My main tasks in this project were:
- To provide the game with sound and sound effects [DirectXTK Audio.h is used in this project]
- Create a game manager.

The game manager handles both soundtracks, music and sound volumes on two different channels. It also sets variables for both players and enemies depending on the difficulty level. The last thing it handles is a highscore list that is updated after each played game, and which can also be seen in the main menu.
